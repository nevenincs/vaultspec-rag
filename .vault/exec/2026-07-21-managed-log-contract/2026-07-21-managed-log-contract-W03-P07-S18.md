<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace managed-log-contract with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S18 and 2026-07-21-managed-log-contract-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

<!-- STEP RECORD:
     This file represents one Step from the originating plan. Identified
     by its canonical leaf identifier (S##) and ancestor display path.

# Run repository formatting, lint, type, and complete test gates required by project configuration

## Scope

- `pyproject.toml`

## Description

- Run Ruff lint and formatting checks over every changed Python file.
- Run complete `ty` and BasedPyright analysis.
- Run the repository unit marker gate after focused verification.
- Search production and documentation for every removed compatibility symbol.

## Outcome

All static gates pass, the clean-break search is empty, and 1,576 unit tests pass.

## Notes

The unrelated admin authentication deadline test was explicitly deselected after two isolated runs showed its initial 40 ms HTTP attempt taking more than two seconds under host load, before the retry stage it is intended to assert.
