<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace large-index-resilience with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S22 and 2026-07-21-large-index-resilience-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

# Drive full indexing from deterministic ledger segments and storage-confirmed commit records

## Scope

- `src/vaultspec_rag/indexer/_codebase_indexer.py`

## Description

- Open a compatible full-run checkpoint before collection mutation.
- Filter deterministic file segments against storage-confirmed ledger units.
- Invoke the ledger callback immediately after each synchronous slice upsert.
- Reuse confirmed point identities when a compatible full generation resumes.

## Outcome

Full indexing now drives its bounded segment stream through one durable generation. A
compatible retry skips confirmed units, while new units advance only after storage returns.

## Notes

Focused lint and type checks passed. Runtime verification is deferred to the required phase
boundary after S25.
