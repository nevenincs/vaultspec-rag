<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace code-document-index-boundary with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S09 and 2026-07-22-code-document-index-boundary-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

     This file represents one Step from the originating plan. Identified

# Route full and unscoped discovery through the shared classifier and resolved policy snapshot

## Scope

- `src/vaultspec_rag/indexer/_codebase_indexer.py`

## Description

- Verify full discovery receives an immutable resolved policy.
- Verify unscoped incremental discovery delegates to the same structured classifier.
- Verify membership and content epochs derive from that exact snapshot.

## Outcome

Full and unscoped code discovery now share one classifier and one operation-scoped policy;
neither path reloads routing while enumerating the repository.

## Notes

Reconciled from production commit `e1254ed`; no additional code change was required.
