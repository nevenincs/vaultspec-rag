<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace code-document-index-boundary with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S13 and 2026-07-22-code-document-index-boundary-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

<!-- STEP RECORD:
     This file represents one Step from the originating plan. Identified
     by its canonical leaf identifier (S##) and ancestor display path.

# Make resident-service preflight consume the structured scan without independently reloading configuration

## Scope

- `src/vaultspec_rag/jobs.py`
- `src/vaultspec_rag/server/_routes.py`

## Description

- Resolve resident-service code admission before durable job creation.
- Carry the exact policy and structured scan into job activation.
- Project admission and preprocessing status from that preflight without reloading config.

## Outcome

Resident-service preflight, response shaping, and index execution share one immutable policy
snapshot and structured scan.

## Notes

Reconciled from the landed service preflight implementation; no additional code change was
required.
