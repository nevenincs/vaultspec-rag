<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace code-document-index-boundary with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S21 and 2026-07-22-code-document-index-boundary-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

# Add the document collection to storage manifest recording and schema compatibility

## Scope

- `src/vaultspec_rag/storage_manifest.py`
- `src/vaultspec_rag/store_schema.py`

## Description

- Define one canonical ordered collection-name projection in the storage schema.
- Record schema generation and exact vault, code, and document names per namespace.
- Infer legacy two-collection manifests conservatively and upgrade them on record.

## Outcome

The persisted storage manifest now describes document ownership explicitly and
retains that evidence across activity stamps, orphan clocks, and prefix rekeys.

## Notes

Formatting, lint, and type checks passed. Legacy entries remain readable as
schema generation 1 until an idempotent current record upgrades them.
