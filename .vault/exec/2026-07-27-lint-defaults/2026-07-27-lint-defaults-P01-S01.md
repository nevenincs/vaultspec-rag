<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace lint-defaults with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S01 and 2026-07-27-lint-defaults-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

<!-- STEP RECORD:
     This file represents one Step from the originating plan. Identified
     by its canonical leaf identifier (S##) and ancestor display path.
     The Remediate upstream-default complexity findings and ## Scope

- `src/vaultspec_rag/_atomic_write.py` placeholders below are machine-filled
     by `vaultspec-core vault add exec` from the originating Step row;
     do not fill them by hand. -->

# Remediate upstream-default complexity findings

## Scope

- `src/vaultspec_rag/_atomic_write.py`

## Description

- Introduce immutable `JsonWriteOptions` for atomic JSON serialization and durability.
- Migrate every configured production call site without retaining the old signature.
- Add a real-filesystem regression for non-default serialization and cleanup.
- Review the migration and resolve the coverage finding.

## Outcome

`write_json_atomically` now accepts one cohesive options value and its migrated
callers preserve their prior formatting and durability choices. Scoped Ruff and the
focused production-path tests pass.

## Notes

The shared `jobs.py` change was preserved while its one atomic-write call site was
migrated. Two `test_jobs_unit.py` failures remain attributable to the concurrent
job-manager split, not this step.
