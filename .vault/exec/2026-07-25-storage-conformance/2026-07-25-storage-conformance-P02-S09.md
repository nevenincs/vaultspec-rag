<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace storage-conformance with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S09 and 2026-07-25-storage-conformance-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

# Report a model-identity disagreement at equal width as nonconforming without raising, leaving the collection readable

## Scope

- `src/vaultspec_rag/store.py`

## Description

<!-- Succinct line-by-line list of steps executed. Use imperative language, mirroring git commit summary lines. -->

## Outcome

A model disagreement at matching geometry records the verdict, logs a warning
naming the superseded model, and returns normally. `conformance_verdicts()`
exposes the recorded verdicts so the health surface can report without
re-probing the backend on every poll.

Not refusing is the deliberate half. The collection is readable and a rebuild is
the remedy, so refusing would remove search for precisely the duration of the
fix. A guard test asserts the ensure call does not raise, proven by widening the
raise to any nonconforming verdict and watching it fail.

## Notes

<!-- Incidents. Data loss. Difficulties; persistent failures. Skipped work. Scaffolds left in code. Failures. -->
