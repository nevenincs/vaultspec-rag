# Project coordination

Aggregate context into an actionable sequence for a developer managing several in-flight
features or an epic and its tracker. Activate for a request to coordinate that work.
GitHub usage, multiple branches, and worktrees alone do not justify loading this skill.
Handle bounded repository questions and single-PR work directly.

Coordination can be entirely local. Use tracker access when remote state matters;
missing access leaves those facts unknown without blocking a local workday plan.

## Method

1. **Set the outcome.** Establish the horizon, workstreams, developer availability,
   priorities, and existing authority. Reuse supplied context; ask only for a missing
   constraint that would materially change the sequence.
1. **Collect relevant state.** Reuse supplied observations. When acquisition is needed,
   run `vaultspec-core project context "<objective>" --json`; add `--repo OWNER/REPO`
   for GitHub issues and PRs. It returns bounded Git state, attention signals, coverage,
   and unknowns. Fetch board, milestone, dependency and vault-plan context only as
   needed. Follow pagination when claiming complete coverage; otherwise state the
   window. Retain identifiers and observation times; distinguish facts from inferred
   relationships.
1. **Choose a sequence.** Connect features, issues, PRs, plans, and worktrees where
   evidence supports the relationship. Identify blockers, competing ownership, stale
   assignments, and local/remote discrepancies. Order ready work by the user's
   objective, known dependencies, deadlines, and available time. Recommend the next few
   actions with reasons and completion evidence. Effort estimates are not facts from
   commit counts.
1. **Coordinate delivery.** Work directly or delegate a bounded assignment to
   `vaultspec-project-coordinator`. Supply outcome, owner, target worktree or tracker
   item, dependencies, authority, and return condition. Implementation follows existing
   decision, plan, and team contracts; priority does not authorize execution. Supply a
   scoped brief to `vaultspec-write` when implementation needs a durable plan. At L4,
   coordinate the external association named in Epic intent and report discrepancies
   between tracker state and implementation evidence.
1. **Act and update.** Perform requested local preparation and tracker changes within
   their authorization. Confirm affected results, refresh changed facts, and recheck
   mutable state before acting. Finish this request with an updated sequence or handoff;
   do not enter an indefinite monitoring loop.

## Ownership and continuity

The coordinator owns priorities, assignments, tracker context, and handoffs. Substantive
decisions, implementation plans, and code stay with their respective roles. Reference
their existing records rather than copying a plan into a competing board checklist. Keep
a compact checkpoint of priorities, assignments, open questions, and next actions in an
authorized coordination record or the handoff response.

Honor prior scoped authorization. Code implementation permission alone does not grant
remote tracker mutations. Prepare a concrete proposal before asking for missing
necessary authority. Inspect affected state before retrying an uncertain mutation.

Discover worktree and base-branch conventions; do not assume branch names, Python, `uv`,
or installation commands. Never force-push; branch or worktree deletion requires an
explicit instruction. Report merge and release readiness without triggering them as a
side effect of coordination.

## Optional hosted evidence

`vaultspec-core project context` works without credentials. With
`VAULTSPEC_CORE_TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, it adds bounded TypeSafe objective-fit judgments;
`--no-hosted` disables them. A supplied `--previous result.json` reuses unchanged
judgments for up to one hour after refreshing observations. Hosted failure preserves
deterministic ordering. This is an order for attention, not dependency scheduling or
execution authority. Check source coverage and uncollected state before making
assignments. Use `search` and `crossref` for governing vault context when needed; do not
request credentials as a prerequisite.

## Return

Lead with the sequence and rationale. Include blockers, ownership conflicts, actions,
unknowns, and the next checkpoint. Use a compact table when useful. Report changes since
the last checkpoint instead of repeating an unchanged inventory.
