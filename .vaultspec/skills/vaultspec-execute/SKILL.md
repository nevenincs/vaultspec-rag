# Execute (vaultspec-execute)

Works an approved plan from its next open Step, leaving a checkpoint after every Step so
any later session resumes without re-reading the cluster. Precondition: the plan has
scoped authorization from the user, recorded per the vaultspec system section.

## Resume

- `vaultspec-core status <feature>` (or the `status` tool) names the next open Step. A
  plan whose Description lacks an `Approved` line needs its authorization established:
  persist existing authorization or present it and ask when none exists.
- On the plan's first entry read it whole; on resume, read the next Step's row and the
  ADR sections it depends on, if any. Confirm the decisions needed by the next Step are
  accepted; reassess coverage when reopening historical work.
- Ground the Step per the `vaultspec-discovery` rule before editing.
- A dispatched worker skips orientation (the orchestrator did it) and works its assigned
  container from the named Step onward.

## Per Step

- Implement exactly the Step's action in the files it names. Run the project's tests,
  lint, and type checks.
- Apply the system's blocker and approval contract. Expected new files, routine path
  corrections, and implementation choices within approved constraints can proceed;
  record row corrections through `plan_edit`. Raise missing prerequisites or uncovered
  choices to the user only when existing authority cannot resolve them. Workers report
  these to the orchestrator. Record the answer and continue.
- Log the Step:
  `vaultspec-core vault exec log --feature {feature} --step S## --related <plan-stem> --row M:path`
  (or the `log` tool), one `--row` per path touched, `--verify '<cmd>=pass'` when a
  check ran, `--note` only on exception. The plan row states the intent and the commit
  carries the diff.
- Close the Step: `plan_progress` tool or `vaultspec-core vault plan step check`. Never
  edit the checkbox by hand.
- Commit once per Step, code, ledger, and plan together, adding the `Vaultspec-Step`
  trailer (`vaultspec-core vault plan trailer emit --step S##`) when the repository
  already uses it. Code never cites the vault.

## Delegation

Do the Steps yourself unless the plan's Parallelization section names assignments that
may run concurrently; then dispatch executor personas (`vaultspec-low-executor`,
`vaultspec-standard-executor`, or `vaultspec-high-executor` by the Step's difficulty) at
approved Steps, each told the plan stem, the feature tag, its Steps or container, and
its starting Step id, and to follow this skill as a worker; they return in their
persona's Return message format. Workers never change plan structure; that routes back
to you.

## Review and finish

- At each point of the review cadence in the vaultspec section, run
  `vaultspec-code-review`; a worker under `vaultspec-team` reports the close to its
  supervisor instead, who reviews. `critical` or `high` findings reopen the affected
  Steps (`vaultspec-core vault plan step uncheck`) and are fixed before continuing;
  lower findings are recorded. In-scope corrections use approved Steps; new scope or
  costly decisions require authorization. Review integrated behavior, not individual
  documents. L1 has no Phase close; combine coincident plan-close and handoff reviews.
- At `L4`, report Wave and Epic completion against the external artifact named in the
  plan's `## Epic intent`.
- When every Step is closed and the last review passes, report the plan complete with
  the modified files and the audit's status.
