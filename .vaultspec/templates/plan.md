<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #plan) and one feature tag.
     Replace {feature} with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Exactly these two tags are allowed; do not append additional tags.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     tier is mandatory for new plans. Allowed: L1, L2, L3, L4.
     L1 = Steps only. L2 = Phases above Steps. L3 = Waves above
     Phases above Steps. L4 = Epic above Waves above Phases above
     Steps; PM association required. Pre-existing plans without this
     field default to L2.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar]]'. The related field
     carries governing ADRs; Steps inherit their evidence transitively.
     Direct supporting evidence links are optional. A decision-free plan
     records its coverage assessment in the Description.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - The related: field carries governing ADRs, if any. Evidence is inherited
       transitively; direct supporting links are optional. No per-row footers.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - No markdown links to files; name a path in backticks: `src/module.py`. -->

<!-- HIERARCHY AND TIERS:
     Epic > Wave > Phase > Step. Step is the canonical leaf-row
     noun. Execution artifact: the plan's ledger.
     Tier is declared in frontmatter as tier: L1/L2/L3/L4
     (mandatory for new plans; pre-existing plans without the
     field default to L2 until `vaultspec-core vault check all --fix` adds it).
     The tier selects containers:
       L1 = Steps only.
       L2 = Phases above Steps.
       L3 = Waves above Phases above Steps.
       L4 = Epic above Waves above Phases above Steps; MUST declare
            a project-management association in the Epic intent
            block prose.
     Select the smallest hierarchy that clarifies coordination:
       L1 = a flat sequence of cohesive revisions, including broad changes.
       L2 = Phases clarify groups of Steps.
       L3 = Waves clarify dependencies between groups of Phases.
       L4 = an Epic coordinates a program with external tracking.
     Duration, file count, package count, or short parallel work alone
     never requires a higher tier.
     Between two tiers take the smaller and promote later.
     Writer never invents containers to qualify a tier. -->

<!-- IDENTIFIERS AND ROW CONTRACT:
     S##, P##, W## are flat, per-document, append-only, immutable.
     Promotion adds containers without renumbering. Gaps are not
     reused.
     Display paths are computed from current grouping:
       Step path:    L1 S##   L2 P##.S##   L3/L4 W##.P##.S##
       Phase heading:        L2 P##       L3/L4 W##.P##
       Wave heading:                      L3/L4 W##
     Row format:
       - [ ] `<display-path>` - imperative-verb action; `path/to/file`.
     Two-state checkboxes only ([ ] open, [x] closed). No per-row
     reference footers; wiki-links and markdown links are forbidden
     in plan body. Authorizing documents go in the plan's `related:`
     frontmatter once.
     ASCII spaced hyphens everywhere; em-dash (U+2014) and en-dash
     (U+2013) are forbidden. Step rows within a Phase are
     contiguous. -->

<!-- COHESIVE GRANULARITY:
     One Step is one cohesive, verifiable commit. Coordinated repeated edits
     may share a row when scope and verification are explicit. Separate
     unrelated outcomes. Name the bounded files or area, expected creations,
     and intended result; avoid unspecified catch-all work. -->

<!-- VAULTSPEC-CORE VAULT PLAN CLI:
     The `vaultspec-core vault plan` CLI is the canonical surface for
     structural manipulation of this plan document. Writers and
     executors MUST use `vaultspec-core vault plan step add/insert/move/
     remove/check/uncheck/toggle/edit`,
     `vaultspec-core vault plan phase add/move/remove/edit`,
     `vaultspec-core vault plan wave add/move/remove/edit`,
     `vaultspec-core vault plan epic intent`, and
     `vaultspec-core vault plan tier promote/demote` for every
     identifier-affecting change; the `plan_edit` and `plan_progress`
     MCP tools reach the Step verbs only, and the above-Step verbs run
     through the CLI. Hand edits are forbidden and
     flagged by `vaultspec-core vault plan check`; canonical-identifier
     preservation is guaranteed only when a verb performs the mutation. Run
     `vaultspec-core vault plan --help` for the full subcommand
     surface. -->

# `{feature}` plan

<!-- One-line headline summary plan. -->

## Description

<!-- First line after approval: `Approved yyyy-mm-dd`, written by the
orchestrator after establishing scoped authorization, including an explicit
advance authorization. Record its basis; ask only when it is absent. Then briefly describe the proposed work.
Reference `{adr}`s, `{research}`, `{reference}`. Supporting documentation
must be read when relevant. State the decision coverage assessment; when no
costly decision is involved and no ADR governs, say so. With several ADRs,
map their scope to Steps at L1 or the relevant containers at higher tiers. -->

## Steps

<!-- The plan's tier (declared in frontmatter as `tier: L1`, `L2`, `L3`, or
`L4`) determines the structure under this section:

- `L1`: a flat list of Step rows (no Phase, Wave, or Epic).
- `L2`: one or more `### Phase` blocks each containing Step rows.
- `L3`: one or more `## Wave` blocks each containing Phase blocks.
- `L4`: a `## Epic intent` block, followed by Wave blocks. -->

<!-- Replace this scaffold with the tier-appropriate structure for your plan.
Format examples for each block type are embedded below as commented
templates. -->

<!-- Progress is recorded through the plan verbs (`plan_progress`,
     `vaultspec-core vault plan step check`), one Step at a time. -->

<!-- PHASE BLOCK FORMAT (L2, L3, L4):
     ### Phase `P02` - rewrite the writer-agent contract

     One sentence stating what this Phase delivers.

     - [ ] `P02.S01` - imperative-verb action; `path/to/file`.
     - [ ] `P02.S02` - imperative-verb action; `path/to/file`.

     At L3/L4 the Phase heading uses the ancestor-aware path
     (### Phase `W01.P02` - ...). The intent sentence is mandatory. -->

<!-- WAVE BLOCK FORMAT (L3, L4):
     ## Wave `W01` - language-only convention rollout

     One paragraph stating what this Wave delivers, which downstream
     Wave depends on it, and which authorizing documents back it.

     ### Phase `W01.P01` - ...
     ### Phase `W01.P02` - ...

     The Wave intent paragraph is mandatory. -->

<!-- EPIC INTENT BLOCK FORMAT (L4 only):
     ## Epic intent

     One paragraph stating the strategic goal, the external project-
     management association (milestone name, project board identifier,
     roadmap entry), the timeline horizon, and the teams or agents
     involved.

     ## Wave `W01` - ...
     ## Wave `W02` - ...

     The ## Epic intent block is mandatory at L4 and absent at L1, L2,
     L3. The plan title (the level-one # heading at the top of the
     document) is the Epic title; no separate Epic heading is emitted. -->

## Parallelization

<!-- State which Steps, Phases, or Waves can be executed in parallel and
which carry hard ordering. At `L1` and `L2`, parallelism is decided
per-Step or per-Phase. At `L3` and `L4`, Waves are sequenced by
default (one Wave must land before the next can begin); Phases
within a single Wave may be parallelized when they share no hard
interdependency. -->

## Verification

<!-- State the mission success criteria for this plan. Each criterion
should be a verifiable check (test passes, surface conforms,
reviewer signs off) rather than a free-form assertion.

The plan is complete when every Step is closed (`- [x]`) and the final
cohesive review passes. At `L4`, the Epic-completion check additionally requires
the declared project-management association to report the Epic
complete.

Review follows the vaultspec system section. L1 has no Phase close;
coincident plan-close and handoff gates share one integrated review. -->
