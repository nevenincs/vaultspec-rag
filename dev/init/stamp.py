"""Idempotence: why a second `just init` costs nothing.

`init` has to be cheap enough that a git hook, a provisioner and a habit can
all call it unconditionally. It cannot get there by making each step fast -
``uv sync --locked`` against an already-synced environment still resolves, and
``npm ci`` deletes ``node_modules`` before it does anything else. It gets there
by not running the steps at all when nothing that feeds them has changed.

What decides that is a digest over the phase's declared inputs - the lockfiles,
the version pins, the manifests - plus this package's own source, so a change
to what `init` DOES invalidates every stamp that was written by the old
behaviour. The digest is per phase, so editing ``uv.lock`` re-runs
``init-python`` and still skips ``init-node``.

A stamp alone is not sufficient and is not trusted alone. It records what the
inputs were, not whether the result still exists, so each phase also declares
the artifacts that must be present. A deleted ``.venv`` with a matching stamp
is stale, which is the case that would otherwise make `init` confidently do
nothing to a broken worktree.

Stdlib-only, by the constraint stated in :mod:`dev.init`.
