"""The shape of an initialization: phases, steps, results, and the report.

Everything a caller can rely on is declared here once, as data. The phases are
fixed and identical in every repository even where one of them has nothing to
do, because a caller that must probe which recipes a repository happens to
define has no contract at all - it has a lookup table. ``just init-node`` in a
repository with no Node dependency graph reports ``skipped`` with a reason,
which is an answer; a missing recipe is an error message about `just`.

Stdlib-only, by the constraint stated in :mod:`dev.init`.
