"""Install the committed git hooks, or say precisely why they were not.

A repository that commits a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and installs nothing has
a gate that exists on paper. Every checkout is one `git commit` away from
skipping every hook in it, and nothing announces that.

The honest options are not "install it" and "stay quiet". They are:

* a hook runner is reachable, so install the hook and say so;
* no hook runner is declared by this repository's dependencies, so say THAT,
  by name, every time `init` runs.

The second case is deliberately not fixed by installing a runner from the
network. Adding a dependency is a change to the lockfile and belongs in a
commit somebody reviewed, not in a bootstrap that quietly reaches for PyPI. So
this step is advisory: it reports the gap, `init` still succeeds, and the gap
is visible in every run's report until a lockfile change closes it.

Stdlib-only, by the constraint stated in :mod:`dev.init`.
