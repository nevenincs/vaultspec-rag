"""Materialize a repository's `.env` from its committed example.

Idempotent by contract, and asymmetrically so: an existing `.env` is NEVER
overwritten, because it carries the operator's own local credentials and
overwriting it is unrecoverable. The only thing this does is turn absence into
presence.

It is a preflight rather than a step of ``init-tools`` for a specific reason.
``vaultspec-a2a``'s justfile sets ``dotenv-load``, which means `just` itself
reads `.env` before it runs anything - so a worktree without one is
under-configured for the very command that would have created it. Running this
first, on every entry point, closes that trap for good.

Invoked as a subprocess so it is an ordinary declared step in
:mod:`dev.init.plan`, visible in the report like any other, rather than a
special case hidden inside the runner.

Stdlib-only, by the constraint stated in :mod:`dev.init`.
