"""The repository-wide exit-code contract, enforced.

`dev/EXIT-CODES.md` states the contract in prose and `dev/exit_codes.py` states
it as data. This module is what makes either of them true tomorrow.

Two populations are asserted:

1. The mapping functions behave as written - in particular that an advisory
   target suppresses FINDINGS and never suppresses a tool that failed to RUN.
2. No justfile recipe re-implements a swallow by hand. `; exit 0`, a trailing
   bare `exit 0`, and `|| true` all map every non-zero status onto success,
   which is the defect the structural `advisory=True` mechanism exists to
   replace. A `$LASTEXITCODE` test on a standalone recipe line is also
   rejected: `just` runs each such line as its own shell process, so the
   variable is unset and the guard is dead code that reads as load-bearing.
