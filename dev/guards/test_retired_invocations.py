"""No live source may cite a recipe invocation that no longer exists.

The harness has been through three renames: a nested module namespace, a
verb-plus-argument dispatch, and the flat hyphenated recipes the justfile
carries today. Each rename left citations behind - in a doc comment, a
workflow, a README, the text an error message prints - and each stale citation
sends its reader to a recipe that errors out.

There is no alias layer to soften that: a `just` alias binds one name to one
recipe and cannot carry an argument, so a two-token invocation has no shim and
never will. This sweep is the whole safety net, which is why it walks the tree
rather than a hand-written file list: the previous cutover swept a list, and
four citations survived it.
