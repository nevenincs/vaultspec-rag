"""THE canonical actionlint provisioner. One implementation, five repos.

Deployed, not called: same constraint as `ci_contract.py` and `preflight.sh`
beside it - ci-fleet is private, every consumer is public.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The fleet acquired actionlint four different ways, one per
repo, and each way was wrong in its own direction:

  vaultspec-core        `curl` the upstream install script, pipe it to bash,
                        run the result. Unpinned and unverified: whatever the
                        script downloads today is what gates the workflows.
  vaultspec-rag         `bash <(curl -sSfL .../download-actionlint.bash)`.
                        The same, with process substitution.
  vaultspec-dashboard   a pinned per-architecture tarball with a verified
                        digest - correct, and 30 lines of YAML nobody can run
                        before pushing.
  cadrumo               a second copy of the dashboard's block, with its own
                        copy of the digests, already at a different version.
  vaultspec-a2a         `uses: docker://rhysd/actionlint` - a daemon dependency
                        on a fleet where a lint gate that reddens because
                        nobody opened Docker Desktop is a gate people learn to
                        ignore.

The dashboard's approach is the right one and is what this file generalises,
with the property that made it hard to reuse removed: it now runs from a
recipe, so the gate a developer runs before pushing is the gate CI runs.

THE ARCHITECTURE PIN IS THE POINT, not tidiness. The dashboard block reached
its current shape after naming `linux_amd64.tar.gz` unconditionally with a
single digest. On an ARM64 runner that does not fail - it PASSES, because the
downloaded file really is the amd64 archive the digest names - and then dies
at `Exec format error` one line later. A verification step that reports
success while handing back an unusable binary is worse than none, because it
reads as assurance. So the digest is per platform, and an unlisted platform is
refused rather than guessed at.

Stdlib only, so it behaves identically on every platform and needs nothing
installed to install something.
