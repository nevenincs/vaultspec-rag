"""Build the standalone ``vaultspec-rag`` and ``vaultspec-search-mcp`` binaries.

PyApp (https://ofek.dev/pyapp) is a Rust bootstrapper from the Hatch
ecosystem. It is configured entirely through ``PYAPP_*`` environment
variables read at ``cargo`` build time; there is no project-side config
file. This script encodes the decided build model once so the release
workflow (and a maintainer reproducing a release locally) can invoke it
identically on every target.

Two binaries are produced from the same PyPI distribution, differing only
in their execution entry point:

- ``vaultspec-rag`` runs ``python -m vaultspec_rag`` (PYAPP_EXEC_MODULE).
- ``vaultspec-search-mcp`` runs the object reference ``vaultspec_rag.server:main``
  (PYAPP_EXEC_SPEC), matching the ``vaultspec-search-mcp`` console script.

The MCP server lives behind the ``mcp`` extra, so the binary installs
``vaultspec-rag[mcp]``: a bare install omits the ``mcp`` dependency and the
server binary would fail to import at first launch. Torch resolves from
default PyPI here, which means the CPU build - see ``tools/packaging`` for
why a CUDA index is not baked into the binary.

The distribution source is the published PyPI package pinned to the release
version: PyApp installs it into a per-user data directory on first launch
(PYAPP_PROJECT_NAME + PYAPP_PROJECT_VERSION), while the CPython runtime is
embedded into the binary itself (PYAPP_DISTRIBUTION_EMBED). The binary
therefore needs no Python on the user's machine, but does resolve
``vaultspec-rag==<version>`` from PyPI on first run - so the release must
be published to PyPI for the binary to bootstrap.

Usage::

    uv run --no-project --python 3.13 python tools/binaries/build_pyapp.py \
        --tag vaultspec-rag-v0.4.6 --outdir dist-bin [--target <triple>]

``--target`` cross-compiles for a Rust target triple other than the host
(the CI matrix uses it to build the macOS x86_64 binary on an Apple Silicon
runner); the matching ``rustup target`` must already be installed. Only the
Python standard library is used, so any Python 3.13 interpreter can run it.
