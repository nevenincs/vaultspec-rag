"""The product identity every release channel renders from.

A channel manifest repeats the same handful of facts - the distribution name,
the binaries it places, the release tag scheme, the licence - in four
different syntaxes. Declaring them once here is what lets one generator serve
every product in the family, and what keeps a Scoop manifest and a Homebrew
formula cut from the same release from disagreeing about what the product is.

This module is the ONLY per-product file in the package. Everything beside it
is shared verbatim with vaultspec-core, which is what makes the delivery
idiom identical across the family rather than merely similar.
