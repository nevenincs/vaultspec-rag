"""Strict reader for the release's aggregated ``SHA256SUMS``.

This module is the direct remedy for the defect that shipped
vaultspec-core-v0.1.60's Scoop manifest with empty hashes. Two things went
wrong there and both are refused here rather than tolerated:

1. The Windows build leg wrote its checksum sidecars with CRLF endings (a
   ``Path.write_text`` newline translation, fixed in
   ``tools.binaries.build_pyapp``), so the aggregate carried mixed endings and
   a whitespace-splitting lookup matched the asset name against
   ``"...msvc.exe\\r"``.
2. The lookup that missed returned an empty string, and the shell guard meant
   to catch that was inert, so the empty value was written to the manifest.

A missing or malformed entry is therefore an exception here, never a default.
The reader also rejects a carriage return outright instead of stripping it:
silently accepting the malformed input would let the build-side regression
reappear undetected, and the aggregate is also consumed by ``sha256sum -c``,
which this reader cannot repair on that tool's behalf.
