"""Generate this release's Scoop manifest and Homebrew formula.

Invoked by the release job in ``.github/workflows/binaries.yml`` once the
binaries are attached, and reproducible locally against a published release::

    uv run --frozen python -m tools.packaging.generate \\
        --tag vaultspec-rag-v0.4.6 --checksums dist-bin/SHA256SUMS

The command replaces an inline ``jq`` rewrite that edited the committed
manifest in place. That mattered: the shell version looked up digests with
``awk``, wrote whatever it found, and its ``test -n`` guard was inert under
``set -e`` (bash exempts every command in an ``&&`` list except the one after
the final ``&&``), so a lookup that found nothing produced a manifest with
empty hashes and a green run. Here a missing digest raises, an unbuilt target
is omitted rather than invented, and a backward bump is refused.

Exit status is non-zero on any refusal, so the workflow step fails loudly
instead of committing a pointer a user would install and fail against.
