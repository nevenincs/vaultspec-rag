"""Render the Scoop manifest that installs the Windows release binaries.

The repository is its own Scoop bucket: Scoop resolves app manifests from a
``bucket/`` subdirectory when one is present, so the product ships through
Scoop without a second repository existing to be kept in sync. Installing is
then::

    scoop bucket add vaultspec-core https://github.com/nevenincs/vaultspec-core
    scoop install vaultspec-core

``checkver`` and ``autoupdate`` are emitted alongside the pinned fields, but
they serve maintainer tooling only - ``scoop install`` reads the committed
``version``/``url``/``hash``. That asymmetry is why the committed hashes are
generated from the release's own ``SHA256SUMS`` and never left blank: an
autoupdate stanza does not rescue a manifest whose pinned hash is wrong.
