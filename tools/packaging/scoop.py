"""Render the Scoop manifest that installs the Windows release binaries.

The manifest is committed to the ACCOUNT channel root,
``nevenincs/homebrew-tap``, rather than to this repository. Scoop resolves a
bucket to a repository, so a per-product bucket makes a user add one for every
vaultspec product they install; the account root is added once and carries them
all. Installing is then::

    scoop bucket add nevenincs https://github.com/nevenincs/homebrew-tap
    scoop install vaultspec-rag

This module only renders the bytes - ``tools/packaging/generate.py`` decides
where they land, via its ``--root``.

``checkver`` and ``autoupdate`` are emitted alongside the pinned fields, but
they serve maintainer tooling only - ``scoop install`` reads the committed
``version``/``url``/``hash``. That asymmetry is why the committed hashes are
generated from the release's own ``SHA256SUMS`` and never left blank: an
autoupdate stanza does not rescue a manifest whose pinned hash is wrong.
